🚀 Exploring the Future of Cybersecurity (2025 and Beyond)

I recently completed an in-depth research project titled “The Future of Cybersecurity from 2025”, where I explored how technology is reshaping the security landscape. 🌐

My study covered key emerging trends such as:

🔹 The rise of AI and Machine Learning in threat detection

🔹 The widespread adoption of Zero Trust Architecture

🔹 The impact of Quantum Computing on encryption

🔹 Growth in Cloud Security and IoT Protection

🔹 The evolution of Passwordless Authentication

🔹 Advancements in Digital Forensics and Cyber Intelligence

This research helped me understand how cybersecurity is not just about technology — it’s about responsibility, strategy, and continuous learning. I am particularly passionate about Digital Forensics and Cyber Intelligence, where investigation meets innovation.

I look forward to growing in this field, protecting digital assets, and contributing to a safer cyberspace for everyone. 💻🔐
